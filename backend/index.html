        <h1>Skin Cancer & Common Skin Diseases</h1>
        <p>
            Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells, often developing on skin exposed to the sun. It is one of the most common types of cancer, but early detection and treatment can lead to a high rate of cure. There are several types of skin cancer, each with unique characteristics and risks.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Skin Cancer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC):</strong> The most common type, usually appears as a small, shiny bump or nodule on the skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):</strong> May appear as a red, scaly patch, open sore, or raised growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Melanoma:</strong> The most dangerous form, often looks like a new mole or a change in an existing mole. Early detection is critical.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Common Skin Diseases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Psoriasis:</strong> A chronic autoimmune condition causing red, scaly patches on the skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):</strong> Causes itchy, inflamed skin, often in children.</li>
            <li><strong>Acne:</strong> Occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, leading to pimples and inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>Rosacea:</strong> Chronic redness and swelling, usually on the face.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitiligo:</strong> Loss of skin pigment, resulting in white patches.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Prevention & Early Detection</h2>
        <p>
            Protect your skin by using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding excessive sun exposure. Regularly check your skin for any changes, such as new growths, changes in moles, or persistent sores. Consult a dermatologist for any concerns.
        </p>
        <h2>When to See a Doctor?</h2>
        <p>
            If you notice any suspicious changes in your skin, such as a new growth, a sore that doesn't heal, or changes in an existing mole, seek medical advice promptly. Early diagnosis can save lives.
